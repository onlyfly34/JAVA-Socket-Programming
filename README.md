#JAVA Socket Programming  
This is a simple demonstration of JAVA TCP Socket programming.  
Preinstall JDK and JRE and compile source code with IDE or CLI.  
  
##CLI：  
`javac Simple_Socket_Client_1.java`  
`javac Simple_Socket_Client_2.java`  
`javac Simple_TCP_Socket_Server_1.java`  
`javac Simple_TCP_Socket_Server_2.java`  
`javac Simple_TCP_Socket_Server_3.java`  
`javac Simple_TCP_Socket_Server_4.java`  
  
After compiling source code, execute with CLI：  
`java XXXXXXXX`  
(ex：java Simple_Socket_Client_1)  
  
##File description：
###[Simple_Socket_Client_1.java]  
This is the simplest version of client.  
  
###[Simple_Socket_Client_2.java]  
This is a client which can transmit data with server side.  
  
###[Simple_TCP_Socket_Server_1.java]  
This is the simplest version of server.  
  
###[Simple_TCP_Socket_Server_2.java]  
This is a server which can successfully accept one clients.  
  
###[Simple_TCP_Socket_Server_3.java]  
This is a multi-thread server which can successfully accept multi clients.  
  
###[Simple_TCP_Socket_Server_4.java]  
This is a multi-thread server which can transmit data with multi clients.
